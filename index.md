## Introduction

Allison Turner an entrepreneur that has acquired a love for solving the issues of office aesthetics from a remote base. Creating my business has been one of the most rewarding and powerful learning experiences. I started with a set job description, however as my client's needs grew so did my description. I am a forever learner who finds great pleasure in constantly growing my business as well as my skillsets. The addition of Full Stack Developer has become a value to me as I produce more projects I gain more knowledge, as I book more clients I "Stack" more experience. 

What began a conversation delving into my love of servicing others has amassed into a commitment to 'Develop' myself for my clients. I strive to provide efficient work and to accomplish client's needs with loyalty.

### Accomplishments

Assisted in creating an effective office system for a thriving private practice. The system transitioned many of the administrative tasks from hard to digital practices. Many of the practice's key medical certification applications were completed by hand for every clinician that came onboard at the practice, extremely time consuming for the admin or the clinician filling out the application. Many of which were dozens of pages long. By switching this to digital process it cut down on time for completion of the applications as well as the approval process. This led to more focus on more patients and booking more appointments, thereby boosting revenue of the practice.
